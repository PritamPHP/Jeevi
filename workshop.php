                                    <p> Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice that helps you connect with yourself, your body and the world around you. In yoga we use postures to strengthen our muscles while relaxing them at the same time. Yoga can be performed by anyone regardless of age or fitness level but it's ideal for those who want to make changes in their lives while also maintaining a healthy lifestyle. </p>

                                    <p>You need to eat the right kind of food in order to keep your body running at its best. Eating healthy means that you are getting all the nutrients your body needs, which will help make sure that your muscles work well and give you energy throughout the day. It's also important that people take care with what they put into their bodies because some items may contain chemicals or additives which could harm them if they are consumed too often overtime (especially children).</p>

                                    <p> Stress and anxiety management is a very important aspect of Jeevi's wellness program. The difference between stress and anxiety is that you know what to do when you are stressed, but when your body starts feeling anxious, you may not know how to manage it. Anxiety can happen at any time in life, but the best way to deal with it is by understanding its triggers so that you can develop strategies for managing these feelings effectively.</p>

Itâ€™s a skill that can help you stay calm and focused, which allows you to better manage stressors.

            <P> Stay positive and keep working towards your goals. The best thing to do is to stay positive in all situations, whether it be at work or home, as well as with family members and friends. </P>

            <P> Donâ€™t let negativity get in the way of your happiness - negative people can make us feel bad about ourselves so it helps if we try our very best not to listen too much or spend time with those who bring us down </P>
