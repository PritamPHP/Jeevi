                <h3>What is a Wellness Coach?
                </h3>

                <P>A Wellness Coach is a trained professional who works with individuals to help them achieve their
                    health and wellness goals. They provide guidance, support, and accountability to help clients make
                    positive lifestyle changes and create sustainable habits. Wellness Coaching takes a holistic
                    approach, considering all aspects of a person's life to help them achieve balance and well-being.
