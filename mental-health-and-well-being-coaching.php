                        Mental health and holistic wellbeing are essential components of overall health and wellness. Good
                        mental health allows us to cope with daily stresses, form healthy relationships, and achieve our
                        goals. Unfortunately, mental health problems are widespread, affecting relationships, work, and
                        quality of life. It is essential to prioritise mental health and wellbeing, just as physical
                        health. This can include stress management, <a href="https://www.jeevi.com.au/mindfulness-meditation-sydney">mindfulness</a>, self-care, and seeking professional
                        support when needed.

                    The World Health Organization has labelled workplace stress as a major health crisis of the modern
                    era. In response, numerous progressive companies are promoting meditation and urging their employees
                    to engage in the practice due to its positive impact on mental health and work output. Multiple
                    studies have demonstrated that minimising stress leads to greater productivity, fewer absences, and
                    a supportive environment that encourages employees to remain with the company.
